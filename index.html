        The earliest known appearance of the phrase was in The Boston Journal. 
        In an article titled "Current Notes" in the February 9, 1885, edition, 
        the phrase is mentioned as a good practice sentence for writing students: "
        A favorite copy set by writing teachers for their pupils is the following, because it 
        'A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"[1] Dozens of other newspapers published 
        the phrase over the next few months, 
        all using the version of the sentence starting with "A" rather than "The".[2] 
        The earliest known use of the phrase starting with "The" is from the 1888 book I
        llustrative Shorthand by Linda Bronson.[3] The modern form (starting with "The") became more common even 
        though it is slightly longer than the original (starting with "A").>History
